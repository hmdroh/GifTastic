# app.js

    When submit button is clicked!

    grab values from the text box:
    
    if the textbox is empty don't do anything, if not execute adding new button with value of the textbox


**creating images**

when a button is clicked on the top, the <img class="imgAnimate"> will be created and it will also have a default attribute of ***onclick = function animategif*** and also rating div will be appended to the main div container with the image.

then all the data in the diplay div will be cleared and all 10 images will be loaded from the gify.
